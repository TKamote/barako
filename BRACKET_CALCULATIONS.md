# Double Elimination Bracket Calculations

## Winners Bracket (Fixed):
- M1-M4: QR (0-4 matches)
- M5-M8: WB Round 1 (4 matches, always)
- M9-M10: WB Round 2 (2 matches)
- M11: WB Round 3 (WB Final)

## Losers Bracket Calculations:

### 8 Players (No QR):
**WB Flow:**
- WB R1 (M5-M8): 4 matches → 4 losers → LB R1

**LB Flow:**
- LB R1 (M12-M13): 4 losers → 2 matches → 2 winners
- WB R2 (M9-M10): 2 matches → 2 losers
- LB R2 (M14-M15): 2 LB R1 winners + 2 WB R2 losers = 4 players → 2 matches → 2 winners
- WB R3 (M11): 1 match → 1 loser
- LB R3 (M16): 2 LB R2 winners + 1 WB R3 loser = 3 players → **Need 2 matches? Or 1 match with bye?**
- LB R4 (M17): Winner from LB R3 → **1 player, needs opponent**
- **LB Final (M18):** LB R4 winner vs ???

**Total LB Matches: 6-7 matches (M12-M18)**

### 9 Players (1 QR match):
**WB Flow:**
- QR (M1): 1 match → 1 loser → LB Qualifying
- WB R1 (M5-M8): 4 matches, but 1 has bye → 3 actual matches → 3 losers

**LB Flow:**
- LB Qualifying (M12): 1 QR loser → **1 player, needs opponent or waits**
- LB R1 (M13-M14): 3 WB R1 losers → **3 players, need 2 matches (1 bye?)**
- LB Qualifying winner joins LB R1? Or goes to LB R2?
- LB R2: ? matches
- **Total LB Matches: ???**

### 10 Players (2 QR matches):
**WB Flow:**
- QR (M1-M2): 2 matches → 2 losers → LB Qualifying
- WB R1 (M5-M8): 4 matches, but 2 have byes → 2 actual matches → 2 losers

**LB Flow:**
- LB Qualifying (M12-M13): 2 QR losers → 2 matches → 2 winners
- LB R1 (M14-M15): 2 WB R1 losers → 2 matches → 2 winners
- LB Qualifying winners (2) + LB R1 winners (2) = 4 players
- LB R2 (M16-M17): 4 players → 2 matches → 2 winners
- WB R2 (M9-M10): 2 matches → 2 losers
- LB R3 (M18): 2 LB R2 winners + 2 WB R2 losers = 4 players → 2 matches → 2 winners
- WB R3 (M11): 1 match → 1 loser
- LB R4 (M19): 2 LB R3 winners + 1 WB R3 loser = 3 players → **Need structure**
- LB Final: ???

**Total LB Matches: ~8 matches (M12-M19+)**

### 12 Players (4 QR matches):
**WB Flow:**
- QR (M1-M4): 4 matches → 4 losers
- WB R1 (M5-M8): 4 matches, all top seeds have byes → 4 actual matches with QR winners → 4 losers

**LB Flow (from user description):**

## Key Questions:
1. How to handle odd numbers in LB (3, 5, 7 players)?
   - Give bye to top seed?
   - Split into 1 match + bye?
   
2. LB Qualifying structure:
   - Always merge QR losers into 1-2 matches?
   - Or varies by QR match count?

3. LB Final structure:
   - How many matches in LB Final?
   - Always 1 match (LB Winner) or multiple rounds?
