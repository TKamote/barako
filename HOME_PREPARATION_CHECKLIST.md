# What You Can Do From Home (Before Going to Table)

## ✅ Action Items You Can Do RIGHT NOW

### 1. Set Up Roboflow Account & Explore (30 minutes)

**Do this first:**
1. Go to [roboflow.com](https://roboflow.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create a new project:
   - Name: "Billiard Ball Detection"
   - Project type: "Object Detection"
   - Annotation format: "YOLOv8"
4. **Explore the interface:**
   - Click around, get familiar
   - Check out the labeling tool
   - Look at example projects

**Why this helps:** You'll be ready to upload immediately when you have videos!

### 2. Check Roboflow Universe for Existing Models (15 minutes)

**Search for existing billiard ball models:**
1. Go to [universe.roboflow.com](https://universe.roboflow.com)
2. Search for: "billiard", "pool", "billiard ball", "pool ball"
3. See if anyone has already trained similar models
4. You might find:
   - Pre-trained models you can use/test
   - Datasets you can learn from
   - Ideas for your own project

**Why this helps:** You might find something you can use or learn from!

### 3. Learn the Labeling Process (20 minutes)

**Watch a tutorial:**
1. Search YouTube: "Roboflow labeling tutorial" or "YOLOv8 labeling"
2. Watch how to draw bounding boxes
3. Learn keyboard shortcuts (saves time!)
4. Understand the workflow

**Or read:**
- [Roboflow Labeling Guide](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate)
- Practice with a sample image if you want

**Why this helps:** Labeling will be faster when you start!

### 4. Prepare Your Workflow (10 minutes)

**Create folders on your computer:**
```
~/billiard-training/
  ├── videos/          (where you'll put videos from phone)
  ├── exported-model/  (where you'll put model files)
  └── notes/           (keep track of what works)
```

**Why this helps:** Organized = faster workflow later!

### 5. Test with Placeholder/Existing Data (Optional - 30 minutes)

**If you want to test the process:**
1. Find any billiard-related images online (for practice only!)
2. Upload 5-10 to Roboflow
3. Practice labeling them
4. This is just to learn the tool - delete after

**Why this helps:** You'll know exactly what to do when you have real data!

### 6. Read Up on YOLOv8 Basics (Optional - 30 minutes)

**Understand what you're building:**
- What is object detection?
- How does YOLOv8 work (simplified)?
- What affects model accuracy?

**Resources:**
- [YOLOv8 Documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
- Simple YouTube explanations

**Why this helps:** You'll make better decisions during training!

### 7. Prepare Your Phone Setup (5 minutes)

**Get ready for when you can record:**
1. Clear phone storage (videos take space!)
2. Check camera settings:
   - Highest video quality
   - How to transfer files
3. Test USB connection to computer (if using)
4. Or set up Google Drive/Dropbox for easy upload

**Why this helps:** Smooth recording session when you get to the table!

### 8. Plan Your Recording Session (10 minutes)

**Think about what you'll record:**
- [ ] Overhead view videos
- [ ] Side angle videos  
- [ ] Close-up shots
- [ ] Wide table shots
- [ ] Different lighting conditions
- [ ] Balls in different positions
- [ ] Some balls pocketed, some visible

**Why this helps:** You'll collect better data when you're there!

## 🎯 Priority Order (Do These First)

1. **Set up Roboflow account** ← Do this NOW (5 min)
